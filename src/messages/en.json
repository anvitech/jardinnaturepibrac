A fascinating topic on the impact of light pollution on biodiversity. Discover how artificial lighting, by disrupting the natural cycle of day and night, modifies the behaviors, interactions, and reproduction of living species. It will also be an opportunity to explore the diversity and beauty of moths, these often invisible but essential creatures to our ecosystems, as well as to take a broader look at the impact of this light pollution on different groups of animals and plants.",
